# MNIST_DL
MNIST is a dataset consisting of handwritten digits, widely used for training and testing machine learning models, particularly for image classification tasks. In this project we do diffrent models :

Baseline(Logistic Regression) :91.8%

Decision Tree :87.2%

Random Forest :96.6%

Support Vector Machine :96.3%

Ensemble learning :96.7%

Key Findings:
- After training the models using Machine learning techniques and deep learning we figured out that deep learning models achieved higher accuracy than Machine learning models.
- After increasing the number of layers the deep learning models performed better.
- In the tuning step we tried 10 numbers of epochs and the accuracy didnâ€™t change but after trying 30 numbers of epochs the accuracy increased to 99.7%.
- Stochastic Gradient Descent optimizer gave better accuracy than Adam.
- After running the model(structure2)  with the transformed PCA features the accuracy increased compared to the original structure 2.
